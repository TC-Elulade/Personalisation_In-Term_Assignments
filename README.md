# Personalisation_In-Term_Assignments
This repository contains all jupyter notebooks, corresponding documents and datasets for Personalisation and Machine Learning module interm coursework.

Assignment 1 has code for a Spotify content-based filtering task on my Spotify playlist. Assignment 1 also has a corresponding pdf file for the report.

Assignment 2 has code for a movie embeddings task.

Assignment 3 has code for the Big 5 Personality task.

The data folder contains all the datasets used for the interim assignments (Assignment 1 required API access so there is no csv file).
